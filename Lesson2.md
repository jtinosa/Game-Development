## Goals
- Motivation for creating the game.
- Games are developed for a variety of purpose.

## Types of Goals
1. Entertainment
 - Many games were developed purely to entertain the players, and many people play games to escape from the stresses of daily life or to relieve boredom.
 - Some games are designed to involved players in in-game actions such as role-play, physical movement, and problem-solving.
 - These allow players to take part in creating entertainment experiences.
2. Social
 -  When more than one person is playing a game, the players might be motivated to interact socially with their opponents or team members.
 -  This social interaction could exist in simple two-person games at an arcade or in massively multiplayer online games (MMOs), with thousands of people playing simultaneously.
3. Educational
 - Games are developed to teach while they entertain.
 - This feature in-game knowledge acquisition—where knowledge of certain topics (such as geography, math, and reading) is taught or accessed within the game itself.
4. Recruitment & Training
 - Games have also been used by the military, government, and even for-profit corporations for recruitment and training purposes.
 - Simulation games, which replicate processes, environments, and objects that exist in the real world, have been used by government and military institutions such as NASA and the Air Force to train astronauts and pilots to adjust to changes in the atmosphere and to navigate vehicles.
 - Corporations have also developed games to help build their employees’ leadership and management skills.
6. Health & Fitness
7. Conciousness & Change
8. Aesthetics & Creativy
9. Marketing and Advertising
