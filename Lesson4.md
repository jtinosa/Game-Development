# Story and Character Development

## Traditional Story Structure

Story structure has been the topic of screenwriting classes for decades. It is seen as a formula that, when applied correctly, can ensure an audience’s/player’s emotional involvement in a film/game. The most common structure is known as the **three-act plot structure**.

### Three Acts:

1. **Beginning (Act I)**: 
    - The most interesting stories begin by placing the audience into the action or drama of the story.
    - The backstory and any background events leading up to this moment can be introduced later.
    - The goal is to capture the audience’s attention. Act I focuses on the character’s problem. 
    - The story should introduce this problem immediately.

2. **Middle (Act II)**: 
    - The middle of the story focuses on the obstacles that stand in the way of the character’s ability to solve the problem introduced in Act I.
    - There are usually a series of obstacles in Act II that the character must overcome.
    - This act comprises the bulk of the dramatic tension in the story.

3. **End (Act III)**: 
    - The story ends when the problem introduced in Act I has been solved.
    - The character often has to systematically face and remove each obstacle in Act II to reach this resolution.

## Story Elements

Storylines exist in many games, but they are not necessary for a satisfying game-playing experience such as puzzle games (e.g., **Tetris**). However, some role-playing games (RPGs) rely heavily on the story. An RPG is mostly like a movie for some players—where the game can become merely a delivery vehicle for the story.

The following story elements—**premise, backstory, synopsis, theme,** and **setting** will help you begin to take your rough ideas and structure them into a preliminary form.

### Key Story Elements:

1. **Premise**: 
    - The premise or high concept is a summary (consisting of 1-2 sentences or a short paragraph) of the game’s purpose and overall theme. 
    - It often appears on packaging associated with the game. 
    - It is intended to intrigue customers, enticing them to purchase the game. This summary should focus on what is unique about your game. 
    - In addressing the player directly, you might also want to indicate the game’s genre.

2. **Backstory**: 
    - A backstory provides information that leads up to where the game begins. 
    - It usually consists of a short paragraph in the game instruction manual, or it appears as text (usually accompanied by a voice-over) at the beginning of the game. 
    - This helps orient the player to the purpose and action involved in the game, and it allows the player to sometimes establish initial bonds for certain characters.

3. **Synopsis**: 
    - A synopsis or storyline can also exist throughout the game itself. 
    - In this case, the player might be involved in the setting and actions that take place in the game. 
    - A running storyline can also help a player escape from reality and become immersed in the “artificial” game world, during which the player can become emotionally involved with the game’s characters.

4. **Theme**: 
    - The theme represents what the story is truly about—even if it’s not shared explicitly with the player. 
    - Themes usually relate to a primary obstacle in the story faced by the main character(s). 
    - The obstacle can be the enemy (villain), nature, society, or the character themselves. 
    - The theme could be a defining question—such as "Is murder justified?" or "Can love triumph?"

5. **Setting**: 
    - The setting or backdrop represents the world that is being explored by the audience, characters, or player. 
    - In creating a game story, think of the world in which your characters will live and interact. Think beyond the stereotypes. 
    - Will it be a real-world location (e.g., Sahara Desert, Alaskan tundra), or a specific time period (e.g., Victorian era, Roaring ‘20s)? 
    - Will it take place in the world of organized crime, behind the scenes of network news, or amid the uncomplicated lifestyle of the Amish? 
    - Also, provide the history and geography of the world and the settings associated with traditional media genres such as science fiction (space), horror (haunted house), or mystery (crime scene), etc.

## Plot and Conflict

### Plot:
- The plot is more about how the story unfolds rather than what the story is about. 
- Game plotting can be part of the game’s story structure—but it can also be dictated by how the game is played. 
- It is a sequence of events in a story that forces a character to make increasingly difficult decisions, driving the story toward a **climactic event** and **resolution**.

### Balancing Conflict:
- Dramatic tension in a story is maximized when the player often seems to be on the brink of disaster but is able to escape repeatedly from this situation by just the narrowest of margins.

## Techniques for Effective Storytelling

### Shifting Focus:
- Even though players make choices and have apparent freedom while playing the game, players can be drawn back to the main storyline.
- This effective storytelling technique can be accomplished by shifting focus while capturing the player’s interest—such as widening the scope of the game by providing more subquests or by introducing new characters or objects that lead the player into other unexplored areas.

### Suspension of Disbelief:
- With suspension of disbelief, your story must somehow cause the players to forget real life and accept the artificial reality you’ve created. 
- This is related to immersion, but it more specifically refers to the players’ acceptance of rules and experiences that might not make sense in the real world.
- Examples: People in a game could fly without the aid of air transport, or the game world might include a rule indicating that all characters who resembled humans were evil, while horrific-looking demons were good.

### Realism:
- In contrast to the suspension of disbelief device, realism can be used in games to mimic the real world as closely as possible. 
- In this case, players want **reality** and **authenticity**. Such stories might include the visual realism of a contemporary real-world setting.

## Classic Character Archetypes

### Hero:
- The hero archetype is the central character in a single-player game.
- The hero will be the player’s avatar—and the player must identify and bond with this character.

### Shadow:
- The shadow represents the hero’s opposite, often the ultimate evil character in a story.
- Sometimes this character remains hidden until the story’s climax, which can add to the story’s dramatic tension.
- The shadow could also represent the **dark side** of the hero.

### Mentor:
- The mentor is a character who often guides the hero toward some action. 
- The mentor is often an older advisor character—someone who might have been in the hero’s shoes at one time, who can provide the hero with **wisdom** learned from that experience of making a similar journey.

### Ally:
- An ally is a character who helps the hero progress on the journey and may also assist the hero with tasks that might be difficult or impossible to accomplish alone.

### Guardian:
- The guardian blocks the progress of the hero by whatever means necessary—until the hero has proven his or her worth.
- The guardian character tests the hero.
- Sometimes the guardian character is the shadow’s henchman.
- The guardian could also be a “block” within the hero’s mind, such as **self-doubt**, **fear**, or **discomfort**.

### Trickster:
- The trickster is a neutral character who enjoys making mischief. 
- Tricksters can either cause severe damage through their pranks, stopping the hero, or they can provide comic relief.

### Herald:
- The herald facilitates change in the story and provides the hero with **direction**.

### Protagonist:
- The protagonist is the main character of the story, responsible for **driving the story forward**.
- A single-player game centers around this character. The protagonist must always **act**, making things happen instead of waiting for them to happen.
- Protagonists often have a **fatal flaw**, which makes them relatable and human, allowing the audience to empathize with them.

### Antagonist:
- The antagonist is the opposite of the protagonist but isn’t necessarily evil. 
- Antagonists and protagonists may have opposing values (e.g., political, ethical, or lifestyle preferences).
- Sometimes, they are linked through a concept called the **unity of opposites**, where they both want the same thing (e.g., a love interest or leadership role), enhancing the conflict.

### Types of Antagonists:
- **Transformational**: An anti-hero who could have been a protagonist but is punished for destructive actions.
- **Mistaken**: Antagonists who are believed to be villains but turn out to be innocent.
- **Exaggerated**: Larger-than-life villains who dominate the story, often becoming more interesting than the protagonist.

## Supporting and Game Characters

### Supporting Characters:
- **Supporting characters**, also known as pivotal characters, exist primarily to prevent the protagonist from walking away.
- These characters often **jump-start** the action, sometimes by carrying out the bidding of the antagonist.
- They bring variety to the story and can be either **sidekicks** or **henchmen** of the antagonist.

### Game Characters:
- Game characters are either **player characters** or **non-player characters** (NPCs).
- **Player Characters & Avatars**: Characters controlled by players. The avatar is the direct representation of the player, often with a personal connection.
- **Non-Player Characters (NPCs)**: Controlled by the game’s artificial intelligence (AI), these characters populate the game world but are not under the player's direct control.

## Character Development Elements

### Character Triangle:
- A **character triangle** forms a three-way relationship among characters. The most common example is a **love triangle**, where the protagonist and antagonist both vie for the attention of a supporting character.

### Character Arc:
- A protagonist rarely changes fundamentally but always **grows** throughout the story. This process is called the **character arc**, illustrated through actions rather than words.
- The character arc can be aligned with **Maslow’s hierarchy of needs**, starting from the self and expanding toward broader societal roles.

#### Levels of Character Growth:
1. **Intrapersonal**: The protagonist is concerned only with their own needs and thoughts.
2. **Interpersonal**: The protagonist forms a one-on-one bond, no longer looking out for just themselves.
3. **Team**: The protagonist bonds with a group of characters sharing common interests, fulfilling a need for belonging.
4. **Community**: The team becomes part of a larger organization, such as a city, school, or faction.
5. **Humanity**: The protagonist reaches **self-actualization**, growing spiritually after achieving comfort, love, and acceptance.
